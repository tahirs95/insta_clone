The concept for this terms project is to build an application capable of helping people practise SQL injection attacks. These challenges will be presented in levels.

Each level of this game will present slightly more sanitized input, forcing the user to apply more complex SQL injection techniques and filter evasions. Additionally, a button to receive hints will be given.

Users will be able to sign up to keep track of their progress through the levels.
